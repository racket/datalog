@defthing[theory/c contract?]{ A contract for Datalog theories. }

@defproc[(make-theory) theory/c]{ Creates a theory for use with @racket[datalog]. }

@defproc[(write-theory [t theory/c] [out output-port? (current-output-port)]) void?]{ Writes @racket[t] to @racket[out]. Source location information is lost. }
@defproc[(read-theory [in input-port? (current-input-port)]) theory/c]{ Reads and returns a theory from @racket[in]. }

@defform[(datalog thy-expr
                  stmt ...)
         #:contracts ([thy-expr theory/c])]{ Executes the statements on the theory given by @racket[thy-expr]. Returns the answers to the final query as a list of substitution dictionaries or returns @racket[empty]. }

@defform[(datalog! thy-expr
                  stmt ...)
         #:contracts ([thy-expr theory/c])]{ Executes the statements on the theory given by @racket[thy-expr]. Prints the answers to every query in the list of statements. Returns @racket[(void)]. }

Statements are either assertions, retractions, or queries.

@defform[(! clause)]{ Asserts the clause. }
@defform[(~ clause)]{ Retracts the literal. }

@defform[(:- literal question ...)]{ A conditional clause. }

@defform[(? question)]{ Queries the literal and prints the result literals. }

Questions are either literals or external queries.

Literals are represented as @racket[identifier] or @racket[(table term ...)].

A table is either an identifier or @RACKET[#,expr] where @racket[expr]
evaluates to a symbol.

External queries are represented as @racket[(ext-table term ... :-
term ...)], where @racket[ext-table] is an identifier bound to a
procedure or @RACKET[#,expr] where @racket[expr] evaluates to a
procedure that when given the first set of terms as arguments returns
the second set of terms as values.

A term is either a non-capitalized identifiers for a constant symbol,
a Racket expression for a constant datum, or a capitalized identifier
for a variable symbol, or @RACKET[#,expr] where @racket[expr]
evaluates to a constant datum. Bound identifiers in terms are treated
as the datum they are bound to.

External queries fail if any logic variable is not fully resolved to a
datum on the Datalog side. In other words, unbound logic variables
never flow to Racket.

External queries invalidate Datalog's guaranteed termination. For
example, this program does not terminate:

@racketblock[
 (datalog (make-theory)
          (! (:- (loop X)
                 (add1 X :- Z)
                 (loop Z)))
          (? (loop 1)))
 ]
